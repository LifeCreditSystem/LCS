The Life Credit System treats clients themselves as stakeholders by including them in the process of creating a sophisticated game-based reward system that is custom tailored to their own personal, familial and professionally determined goals, targeted behaviors, skill strengths and deficits and unique cognitive-emotional presentation.  By treating clients as stakeholders in this process, LCS helps to build a culture and common language of authenticity, accountability and interdependence.</h1></li>

LCS uses numerical and graphical data arrays as well as a Client Avatar - a virtual character that represents the client and changes depending on performance - to connect clients to their data in realtime.  Data collection and automatic aggregation are all achieved by using Google products and services (Google Drive, Google Forms, Google Sheets and Google Scripts).  Trello, another propriety platform that provides an elegant visual organizer, is used to structure the process of reviewing the data with clients.</h1></li>

This means both making good choices in the moment and setting clear goals for positive future outcomes.  A fundamental part of how this is put into practice is through documentation.  In addition to serving as an executive functioning tool, Trello is also used to document events and capture insight.  Together with their parents, teachers and/or therapists, clients learn to manage a constantly evolving document that can transition with them throughout their life.</h1></li>
