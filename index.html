<p>Created by Clarence Dow-Spielman, LCS is a <a href="https://github.com/ClarenceDowSpielman/LCS/wiki/Method-and-Corresponding-App-Function">method</a> of working with high-functioning children, teens and young adults diagnosed on the autism spectrum.  The Life Credit System treats clients themselves as stakeholders by including them in the process of creating a game-based reward system that is custom tailored to their own personal as well as professionally determined transition goals, behaviors, needed skills and unique cognitive-emotional presentation.</p>

<p>Typically, data is collected by professionals, evaluated by professionals, and viewed by stakeholders which may or may not include those with the diagnoses that are selected for treatment.  Clarence uses numerical and graphical data arrays in his therapy sessions to give feedback directly to his clients.  Self-review and self-reporting is at the core of LCS.  LCS prompts clients to become engaged in seeing themselves gaining skills, changing behavior and demonstrating self-determination, self-advocacy, self-regulation and self-awareness.</p>

<p>Gamification is the application of gaming principles and methods in a traditionally non-game arena.  The gamified reward system used in LCS grants experience points, or 'Life Credits', for performance across categories determined by all stakeholders in the treatment team.
